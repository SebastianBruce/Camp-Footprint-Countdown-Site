# Camp Footprint Countdown

This site was made for the CMTA to display a countdown for Camp Footprint!

It includes countdowns to both camps aswell as a button that creates a visually appealing and easily sharable image for the countdown.

## Versions

This includes 2 versions:
- One with the East Camp countdown first
- One with the West Camp countdown first

This is for easy changes based on whichever camp is closest, just use that directory

## How to use

When the camp date changes, simply open the **"Footprint-Countdown-West-First\js\script.js"**
All thats required is changing the dates in line 1 and 2 of the code
```
var countDownDate = new Date("{date}").getTime();
var countDownDate2 = new Date("{date}").getTime();
```
Be sure to use the corresponding version for whichever camp is next
