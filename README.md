# Camp Footprint Countdown

This site was made for the CMTA to display a countdown for Camp Footprint!

It includes countdowns to both camps aswell as a button that creates a visually appealing and easily sharable image for the countdown.

## Versions

This includes 2 versions:
- One with the East Camp countdown first
- One with the West Camp countdown first

This is for easy changes based on whichever camp is closest, just use that directory

## How to use

When the camp date changes, simply open the **"\js\script.js"**

All thats required is changing the dates in line 2 and 3 of the code
```
var westDate = {date};
var eastDate = {date};
```
Also ensure that you update the countdown images, a link to the canva template can be found in **assets\canvalink.txt**

Be sure to use the corresponding version for whichever camp is next
